            <h2>Coding process!</h2>
            <p>Coding this whole website might've been exhausting, but with some simple principles, I was able to pull through. <br>
            Here are my no. rules when coding a new page: <br>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Copy and paste the <a href="genstruc.html">'genstruc.hmtl'</a> structure. This is the basic code and strucutre every page of the website has to have.</li>
            <li>Use the <a href="base.html">'base.html'</a> or <a href="contact.html">'contact.html'</a> page as an inspiration if I want to use columns</li>
            <li>Ask <a href="wooper.html">Wooper</a> for design or content ideas</li>
            <li>Use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> if I don't know how to code or format something</li>
            <li>Visit <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> if any issues occur</li>
            <li>Copy some cool code snippets from <a href="https://codepen.io">Codepen</a> if I want to make my website stand out</li>
            <li>Last but not least, ask my dear, loyal friend <a href="https://chat.openai.com">Chat</a> for some help if I could not get further (only occured twice ok?)</li>
          </ol>
          
          </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="column">
            <h2>Main inspiration</h2>
            <p>My inspo for this website comes from many places, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange_(2016_film)">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra_and_the_Princesses_of_Power">She-Ra</a> and maybe even the many companies of Elon Musk.
            In general, I juust wanted a cool, functional website that didn't have a real life purpose. It was supposed to be just for fun. I don't want anyone taking this website seriously.
            <br> But I cannot give all the credit to myself. There are some (real) people I'd like to thank: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Dani: Thanks for the content inspo, you really made this website more fun and exciting.</li>
              <li>Timo: Thanks for the gradient and GitHub inspo. You're the one who taughtme 'git push' anyways...</li>
            </ul></p>

          <div class="column">
            <h2>Final Testament</h2>
            <p>Now, this is the last page of the website that I'll be commiting. After this, I'm submitting my project. Here is my short recap/report: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>I was supposed to submit this a week ago. Whoops. But I don't regret it since I had some time to spice this website up</li>
              <li>To be honest, it didn't turn out as cool as I thought it would. I overestimated my coding skills</li>
              <li>This website is the perfect combo between chaotic and formal. I love it</li>
              <li>Using GitHub saved me so much time, I will definitely use it again</li>
            </ul></p>
